## üìñ Description
TechMarkt, a leading German online retailer specializing in consumer electronics and household appliances, faces a critical challenge in their digital-first business model: providing personalized customer consultation at scale.

### üéØ Business Problem

As an online-only retailer, TechMarkt identified that customers often feel overwhelmed by their extensive product catalog and require expert guidance during the purchase decision process. Without physical stores or accessible consultation services, many customers struggle to make confident purchase decisions, particularly non-technical customers who need simplified product recommendations tailored to their specific needs.

### üí° Solution and Value Proposition

- **Instant Product Consultation** - Personalized recommendations based on customer requirements
- **Simplified Technical Guidance** - Complex product specifications translated into customer-friendly language  
- **Order Support** - Streamlined assistance with order fulfillment and tracking
- **24/7 FAQ Resolution** - Immediate responses to common customer inquiries

### üìà Business Impact

This solution enables TechMarkt to offer the consultation experience that customers need but typically can't access online, delivering improved purchase confidence, higher customer conversion rates (hypothesis to be proven), and customer support relief by automating routine inquiries.
